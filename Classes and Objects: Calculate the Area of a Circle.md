# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle
## NAME: MONISHA P
## REF NO: 25018486
## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## 🧾 Program

import math

class cse:
    
    def mech(self, r):
    
        area = math.pi * r * r
        
        print("Area of the circle =", area)

radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

obj = cse()

obj.mech(radius)


## Output
Enter the radius of the circle: 7

Area of the circle = 153.93804002589985

## Result
Thus, a Python program using class and object was successfully written to calculate the area of a circle using the given radius.
