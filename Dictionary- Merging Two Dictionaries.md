## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries
## ANME: MONISHA P
## REF NO: 25018486
## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## 🧾 Program
dict1 = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30}

dict2 = {'b': 40, 'd': 50}

def merge(d1, d2):

    merged_dict = {**d1, **d2}
    
    return merged_dict

result = merge(dict1, dict2)

print("Merged Dictionary:", result)


## Output
Merged Dictionary: {'a': 10, 'b': 40, 'c': 30, 'd': 50}

## Result
Thus, the Python program to merge two dictionaries using the ** unpacking operator was executed successfully.
If duplicate keys exist, the values from the second dictionary overwrite the values of the first dictionary.
